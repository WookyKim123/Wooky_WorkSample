# WorkSamples

The two codes or programs I have written are in processing language. As well as I am confident in coding in the language Java, I wanted to show you the products that I have made. Since the codes written in Java won't be able to show or exhibit something I used the application "Processing".

# Project Descriptions

## _Breakout_

The first code I have attached above is the code for the game "Breakout". As I wanted to create an interactive game for people, I decided to create the "Breakout" game by myself. The game making process was very difficult, however I believe I managed it very well. There were some parts that I wasn't able to fix, however I was proud of the work I have done. In addition to the code, I also added a document which shows the process of my work. Starting from brainstorming to evaluation of my code, I also included surveys I have done with the some students in my school of all grade level. This survey helped me in the evaluation section and helped me realized that there was still work to do.

## _3D Brownian Motion_

This code shows my work I have done in creating the "random walk" or the brownian motion. I was very fascinated by this idea after watching a video on Youtube. I tried it in 2D and then I decided to make it into a 3D. It was difficult yet I tried hard and I managed well. I was very happy with what I have done.
